# The Adventure Guild
Inspired by my love of Dungeons and Dragons, the Adventure Guild is an eCommerce application that allows users to purchase top-quality gear and weapons, and receive expert advice to ensure their adventuring group is fully prepared for any quest.

### Why Dungeons and Dragons?
Ecommerce projects have been done to death, so I decided that while learning to implement one could provide valuable knowledge, I wanted to create something with more character and depth. I couldnâ€™t bring myself to build another generic store with stock photos and basic product listings.  
  
By choosing Dungeons and Dragons as my theme, I aimed to make the project more engaging and fun, blending my passion for storytelling and adventure with the practical skills of eCommerce development. Yes, I took inspiration from the top online retailers to create the site, but I also made it my own creation, infusing it with the spirit of DnD.

### A Few Caveats:
This is very much a work in progress. While I'm posting the link to the site, please note that this is still a prototype of the store. This version has no database, you can't actually purchase your items, and some buttons are just for show.  
I'll be updating the site as I have time, with more features and functionality to come.
